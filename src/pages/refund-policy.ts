        <p>Thank you for choosing Inlits. We value your satisfaction and strive to provide the best possible experience with our digital content and services. This Refund & Return Policy outlines our guidelines for refunds and returns.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Digital Content Purchases</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 E-Books and Digital Publications</h3>
        <p>Due to the nature of digital products, all purchases of e-books and digital publications are generally final and non-refundable once the content has been accessed or downloaded. However, we understand that issues may arise, and we evaluate refund requests on a case-by-case basis under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Technical issues that prevent access to or proper functioning of the purchased content</li>
          <li>Accidental purchase (if reported within 24 hours and the content has not been accessed)</li>
          <li>Content significantly different from description</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>1.2 Audiobooks</h3>
        <p>Refunds for audiobooks follow similar guidelines as e-books. If you experience technical issues that prevent you from accessing or properly using an audiobook, please contact our support team within 7 days of purchase.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Subscription Services</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Monthly and Annual Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>For subscription-based services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings.</li>
          <li>Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period.</li>
          <li>We do not provide partial refunds for unused portions of your subscription period.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.2 Free Trial Conversions</h3>
        <p>If you signed up for a free trial that converted to a paid subscription:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You will not be eligible for a refund if you fail to cancel before the trial period ends.</li>
          <li>It is your responsibility to cancel before the trial period expires if you do not wish to continue with a paid subscription.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Creator Services and Sessions</h2>
        <p>For scheduled sessions with creators:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cancellations made more than 48 hours before the scheduled session are eligible for a full refund.</li>
          <li>Cancellations made between 24-48 hours before the scheduled session are eligible for a 50% refund.</li>
          <li>Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled session are not eligible for a refund.</li>
          <li>If a creator cancels a session, you will receive a full refund or the option to reschedule.</li>
        </ul>
